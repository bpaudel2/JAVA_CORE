Setting things up:
1) Install JRE. JRE is JAVA RUNTIME ENVIROMENT. JRE is needed in order to run 
	JAVA programs. 
2) Install JDK. JDK is JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT. JDK allows you to create JAVA 
	program yourself. 
	*** Make sure match your jdk version to your jre version. ***
3) Eclipse IDE. IDE stands for Integrated Development Enviroment. 

JAVA is the most used programming language. 
JAVA class has .java extension. JAVA is human readable. Once you write .java, then 
you turn your JAVA file to binary file using Javac (which is part of JDK). 
But you usually use IDE to write java code. Once you get one binary file for each java file.
These binary file has extension .class. Java Virtual Machine (JVM) reads this class file. 
JVM is VM that is running on your machine. JVM is extra layer on your machine. That's why 
JAVA is write once and run everywhere. JRE sets up and creates and run JVM.
